# Advent of Code 2024

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual event in December where participants solve daily programming puzzles. Each day from December 1st to December 25th, a new puzzle is released.

For more information, visit the [Advent of Code 2024 website](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

## My Code for 2024

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges. Each day's solution is implemented in a separate file, organized by day. The code is written in [your programming language of choice], and I have included comments and explanations to make it easier to follow along.

### Folder Structure

-   `day-1/` - Solutions for Day 1
-   `day-2/` - Solutions for Day 2
-   `...`

Each folder contains the following files:

-   `example-input.txt` - An example input file for the day's puzzle.
-   `input.txt` - The input data for the day's puzzle.
-   `utilities.ts` - Shared code that is used across multiple solutions.
-   `puzzle-{number}.ts` - The solution code for the day's puzzle by number.

The code is written in TypeScript, and I have the node js package set up to allow for running solutions in the main directory through the terminal with the following command:

```bash
npm run 2024:1:2 #{year}:{day}:{puzzle-number}
```

Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback or suggestions. Happy coding!
